## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I am Mehraz Hossain, a **Full-stack Web Developer** (specializing in **MERN Stack**).

👨‍💻 I am dedicated to perfecting my craft by learning from more seasoned developers, remaining humble, and continuously making strides to learn all that I can about development.

📚 Outside the world of tech too, I love teaching, writing & reading books on **personal development** & **financial literacy**. My favorite ones are **The Compound Effect** by _Darren Hardy_ in the genre of personal development and **Rich Dad Poor Dad** by _Robert Kiyosaki_ in the genre of financial literacy.
